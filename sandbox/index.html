          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
          is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
          example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
          its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
          and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
          structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
          variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
          example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
            to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
            client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
            HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
            and page navigation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
            relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
            extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
            provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
            the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <header>Hello world</header>
      <article>
        To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your
        first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
        <code
          >function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
          greetMe("World");
        </code>

        Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
        browser!

    <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
      <header>Variables</header>
      <p>
        You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The
        names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
        dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because
        JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through
        "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
      </p>
      <p>
        You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers.
        You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in
        identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
        _name.
