Personal Website

My website uses 3 different domainnames and serives.
I have coded the homepage using HTML and CSS on GitHub.
For a photography portfolio I am using Cargo Collective.
For my blog I am using Tumblr.

All interfaces are designed using CSS to match each other
in terms of look, feel and use.
