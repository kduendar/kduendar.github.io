# Personal Website

You can reach the website at 
https://kdundar.github.io/

My website uses 3 different platforms:
- I have coded the homepage using HTML, CSS, and Java on GitHub.
- For a photography portfolio I am using Cargo Collective.
- For my blog I am using Tumblr.

I use css files to maintain visual unity among the different platforms.

Photographs on my website and blog are my own work.
