Personal Website

My website uses 3 different domainnames and services.
- I have coded the homepage using HTML, CSS, and Java on GitHub.
- For a photography portfolio I am using Cargo Collective.
- For my blog I am using Tumblr.

All interfaces are designed using CSS to match each other in terms of look, feel and use.

The JavaScript code for the moveable images on my homepage is based on the example at the following link:

Feel free to inspect or use the code.
I would appreciate if you don't copy the design completely, but if you really like it you can go for it.
